v1.0: 
complete the self-consistent loop part and get the correct W compared with directly integration in t

v2.0:
complete the MC updates(complete, but not over-complete);
0-order and 1-order simulations are correct, compared with Nikolay's Sigma_full.dat

v2.1:
MC updates(complete, but not over-complete);
0, 1, and 2-order simulations are all correct, compared with Nikolay's Sigma_full.dat
